                                    When we encounter the world of Nintendo games, we gradually find that these fun, young and old games are composed of several ingenious gameplay ideas, for example, "everything can be swallowed" in Kirby and the Forgotten Land or Mario "with the mysterious hat", or 
                                    Link in A Link Between Worlds, who can walk freely between walls. These ideas run throughout the game, they are vivid and tense, with extremely high adaptability and great extensibility. The combination of such an idea and elements in the environment brings players unique and irreplaceable fun. So next, let's talk about A Link Between Worlds and its unique gameplay fun.

                                    This is a traditional 2D Zelda game, which has almost all the characteristics of previous traditional Zelda works, such as the theme of growing up and saving the princess, the focus and emphasis on exploration, the dungeon design where adventure and exploration coexist, the familiar organs and bosses, the table world and the inner world. This all means that this is a very classic work of gaming.
                                    <br><br>However, in addition to these classic elements, the biggest feature of this work is that Link gained the ability to look into the 2D space of the wall as long as he stand next to a wall, thus creating a unique play content.

                                    At the same time, in order to limit the player, the designers bound together the mural ability and magic slot. Once the magic slot is depleted, then Link will immediately leave the wall, waiting for the magic slot to be restored again. In addition, it is conceivable that once Link becomes a 2D mural, he will not be able to attack or use any skills, which is obviously a design necessary for the balance of the game.

                                    When we talk about Breath of the Wild, it seems that all the previous laws no longer work. This is a new, landmark open-world game that is no longer the same as all the previous Zelda's. We find that the traditional hammer, hook lock, and other classic props are replaced in this one by the skills of the Stone of Shikar, and Breath of the Wild seems to have become something completely new.

                                    The Breath of the Wild's open-world experience is unmatched in the gaming world due to the open-world design focusing on how the player traverses the terrain to the point that the keyword most closely associated with The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, is “open-world”. So how did Breath of the Wild design the perfect open-world experience? Breath of the Wild perfected the design by considering four key points:
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                    <b>(a)	Non-compulsory mission</b>
                                    <br>In this game, missions are more as guides for the players rather than mandatory experiences. What a player must do is to complete the tutorial and defeat Gaynon. The rest of the experience is up to the player to decide and customize their own settings. You can even ignore the hints and feel the fun of the game in an unknown situation. There is no forced guidance in the game, even in the initial terrace where players do not understand anything. Nintendo that develops Zelda games let the players understand and feel an interest in the game themselves.
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-dark">
                                    <b>(b)	Gameplay close to reality</b>
                                    <br>The gameplay is perfectly close to reality, increasing the sense of immersion. When Link initially wakes up from the cave and has no equipment, he picks up apples on the roadside and fallen branches to replenish his strength as props; this experience perfectly echoes the initial appearance of human beings in the world when they are also developed step by step using the available resources. In addition, the game perfectly simulates the natural world experience, such as slippery rocks, the inability to climb smoothly on a rainy day, etc. Although these settings are not displayed with a prompt box, they enable the program to immerse the player in real-life experience.
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-dark">
                                    <b>(c)	Perfect character climbing design</b>
                                    <br>Breath of the Wild offers complete freedom to the player, with a perfect character climbing design that theoretically allows the player to reach anywhere. The designers seem to be telling players where the world's borders are from the start, and everywhere else can be explored freely. But players also seem unable to go to every corner at the beginning but are limited by stamina, which can be a very clever design. Players are only restricted by their abilities, rather than being forced to drop a goal because of an air wall or other external element, without hindering the player's goal, improving stamina or refining the path. This design language is common in other Zelda's games.
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-dark">
                                    <b>(d)	Invisible exploration order</b>
                                    <br>Game designers do not expect players to be able to walk everywhere from the very beginning but prefer most players to follow an invisible exploration order. Setting higher terrain implies that players avoid exploring dangerous areas initially but instead start with simple, easy-to-reach places. There are times when the world environment is also a hindrance, with settings such as snowy mountains and rocky terrain adding to the difficulty of exploration, as players are forced to keep an eye on their state in these dangerous environments until they have acquired equipment or props that work with the environment.
                                    <br>In addition, when the developers were discussing the map design, they said that they would design higher barriers at the border of each area so that the players could not be aware of the design inside the area at the very beginning but take this as a motivation to overcome obstacles.
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-dark">
                                    So this is the reason why people are so willing to play this game. Even years after the game was released, players are still exploring the world, trying to fly the walls, trying to solve Gaynon faster, and even going out of their way to test the world for various bugs. Therefore, the groundbreaking open-world design is the greatest appeal of this game.

                                    1.	Perhaps it comes from the game itself, the surprise of the player who finds that his experience can be used to solve the game's puzzles.

                                    2.	It also comes from the challenge to the developers. Although the developers and the players should be on the same side, when the players find themselves a deviant solution, they will think they have beaten the developers. Such a victory is positive and enhance the confidence of the players for themselves and the game itself.

                                    In short, Breath of the Wild provides players with rules rather than gameplay, and gameplay will be explored by players on their own initiative. Players who like to solve puzzles might explore hidden temples from just words, and players who like to fight might think about repeatedly challenging various centaurs. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild offers a unique experience for each type of player, shaped by the player's choices. This is what I think makes Breath of the Wild so memorable.
